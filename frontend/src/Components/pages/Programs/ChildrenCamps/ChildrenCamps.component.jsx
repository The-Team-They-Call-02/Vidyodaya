            Camps are held over weekends or during the term holidays. Teenage
            children come to a particular center and take part in multiple
            activities ranging from computer classes to games to cultural
            activities. Although most of these activities are planned so that
            the children get to learn what they would otherwise not learn at
            school, a lot of other inputs get included in a very unobtrusive
            way.
            <br />
            <br />
            We have heard from many of the youth that their decision to go on
            for higher studies or get involved with the Sangam activities has
            been largely due to the influence of the camps they had attended.
            <br />
            <br />
            They mentioned that at the camps the ideas discussed the questions
            raised and the challenges they would face in future, had all
            contributed to the direction and the decisions they had made.
            <br />
            <br />
            The trust thus believes that the youth have to build their future
            and that camps play a significant role in shaping their future.
