              Viswa Bharati Vidyodaya Trust (VBVT) has been conducting an
              intensive residential Two-year teacher training programme for
              batches of around 15 youth from the adivasi community since 2009.
              There was a need felt among these trained teachers to upgrade
              their own teaching skills that could enable them to reach to
              children in an efficient way. To address this need, in the year
              2015, VBVT has started a 2 years Skill Upgradation program to a
              batch of 15 trained teachers (8 male and 7 female) from 3 tribes
              Paniyas, Mullakurumbas and Bettakurumbas – but 1 of them left the
              training due to personal reasons.
