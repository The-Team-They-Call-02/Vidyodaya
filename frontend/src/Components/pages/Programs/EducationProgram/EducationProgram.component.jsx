              Another important area of intervention of Vidyodaya is to provide
              academic, financial and material support for those who wish to go
              on for higher education.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Tutorial support has become essential to score grades in order to
              pursue higher education and so financial support for this has to
              be provided. This is being made available to children in the
              classes from 8 to 12.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Financial support is also being provided for those who wish to
              pursue education at the university level and for this purpose a
              savings scheme is already initiated. A Loan scheme is also being
              initiated where each Area has a fund which can be lent out. This
              will be repaid through the child’s savings on a long term basis.
              The savings of the children will not be used for this instead a
              separate fund will be created. The savings will be credited into
              individual savings often idleness.

          <h3 id="teacher-training">Teacher Training</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Today we stand at the threshold of education, but do not find
            entrance. The children are in schools with 95% of them in government
            schools and getting little in terms of even literacy and numeracy as
            can be seen from the report on the tests conducted by us. It is very
            doubtful whether we can make a major change in the govt’s attitude
            to schooling as there is a lot of resistance from the teachers. The
            only answer then is to take on this task ourselves to the best of
            our ability. This is the only way we are able to see a some critical
            change taking place in the lives of these children in the immediate
            future. Therefore improving the quality of education will be the
            keystone of our intervention.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We are aware that in the final analysis quality in education will
            depend upon the extent to which the community is willing to exercise
            its authority. But this authority must also be tempered with
            knowledge. We have there decided on two approaches – one, through
            community empowerment and secondly, an institutional approach. These
            are not exclusive approaches as the institutional approach will be
            through the community and the community’s empowerment will be
            through the institutional inputs that are built in.

            A residential school for drop-out children – with the Sarva Shiksha
            Abhiyan (SSA) to address the problem of a large number of drop-outs
            in the age group of 6-14 years. The trust along with the support
            from SSA runs a residential school upto 8th class.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Government records showed that about 120 children had dropped out of
            school between standard II and VIII. It was shocking to note that of
            these 110 children were from adivasi community.

            The residential school till class VIII has 100 children who come
            from a radius of about 40 kilometer from Gudalur and Pandalur taluk.
            Although SSA funds all the cost to run the school, many other
            expenses had to be borne by the trust.

          <p>
            Vidyodaya school has been accredited as a Study Centre by the
            National Institute of Open Schooling under the Open Basic Scheme.
            This allows children to appear at the class 3 – A level, Class 5 – B
            level, Class 8 – C level exams conducted by the school.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            It gives the school tremendous flexibility in terms of teaching
            methods and curriculum. During the last three years, only the Nodal
            centre has been sending candidates for examination. However some
            students from far off villages who wish to complete schooling upto
            class 8th level, have also enrolled and completed their exams.
