            The Viswa Bharati Vidyodaya Trust is a charitable body registered
            (No. 41 of 1993) under the Indian Trusts Act. Its registered office
            is 12/669B, Thottamoola, Gudalur – 643 212, The Nilgiris, Tamilnadu.
            It has nine members on the board of Trustees, which includes the
            Managing Trustee. Six of the Trustees are from the adivasi
            community.

            The VBVT’s first programme was the Vidyodaya School, a school
            modelled along an alternative pedagogy.

              tests, but based on a holistic approach

          </ul>
        </TextContainer>
        <TextContainer>
          <p>
            The Trust had also been interacting with the Adivasi Community of
            Gudalur and coordinating the educational programmes for ACCORD, a
            sister NGO working exclusively with adivasis. VBVT undertook to
            train the Adivasi Teacher Volunteers, follow-up of the non-formal
            centre of ACCORD and thirdly, provide the supervisory support to the
            Adivasi Teachers who were placed in the Government’s Tribal Schools.
            However, the Vidyodaya School remained its central activity.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In 1996, on a request from the adivasi community, the Trust decided
            to concentrate its activities on the Adivasi Community of Gudalur
            Block. Its first step was to open the school to adivasi children.
            Our experience with the government’s tribal schools had clearly
            shown that unless the school had adivasis as teachers the children
            would not respond favourably.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            From 2004 the school has had around 75 students, all of whom are
            adivasi children, except for one or two staff children. The school
            does not have the space to accommodate more and so we have been
            compelled to stop further admissions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In 1996, the Trust also took on four adivasi educated youth, who
            were previously working in the Govt. Residential Schools as Tribal
            volunteers, to train as Teachers on an experimental basis. We
            realized that in-service training alone was not adequate, so the
            following year 10 more volunteers were taken on for a full time 2
            year residential training. Of these four left during the year as
            they found other sources of employment. The rest have continued and
            today form the Education Team, which handles the entire education
            programme.

        <TextContainer>
          <p>
            In the year 2000, VBVT decided that the adivasi community, having
            seen their children’s progress in Vidyodaya school, was now ready
            for an educational intervention and so launched a major programme
            covering 138 of the 303 adivasi villages of the two taluks of
            Gudalur Block. By 2015 it had covered all the villages.
